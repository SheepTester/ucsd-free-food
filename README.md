# ucsd-free-food

This is the frontend for a UCSD free food event calendar.

Other repos:

- [Instagram scraper](https://github.com/SheepTester/floofy-bot/blob/main/src/commands/free-food.ts): Bizarrely, the cron job running the scraper is built into my Discord bot.

- [MongoDB proxy](https://github.com/SheepTester/web-server/blob/master/server/free-food/index.js): This adds like a fourth database to my aging web server, which is hosted on the same mini PC as my Discord bot.

- [Old repo](https://github.com/SheepTester/sgy-sgy/tree/master/ig): Still deploys to the old URL, [free-food-ucsd.vercel.app](https://free-food-ucsd.vercel.app/).

- [Even older repo](https://github.com/Chaitya2108/fast-find): This project was originally made for LA Hacks 2025, but the judges did not share our appreciation of free food, perhaps because UCLA has all-you-can-eat dining halls.

The frontend used to be hosted on Vercel, but I kept hitting the Vercel free plan limits (despite only getting like 50 visitors a day) and eventually the project got paused.
